# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Cascading Style Sheets, commonly referred to as **CSS**, are a fundamental technology in web development used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. CSS works hand in hand with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to define how web content should look and be displayed in web browsers.

## Key Concepts

- **Selectors**: CSS employs selectors to target HTML elements for styling. Selectors can be based on element types, IDs, classes, or other attributes. They specify which elements on a web page will be styled.

- **Properties and Values**: CSS properties define the visual aspects (e.g., color, font size, spacing) of selected elements. These properties are assigned values that dictate how the styling should be applied.

- **Cascading**: The term "Cascading" in CSS refers to the order of precedence when multiple styles are applied to the same element. Styles can come from various sources, including external stylesheets, internal styles within the HTML file, or inline styles directly on elements. CSS resolves conflicts and determines the final style using a specific set of rules.

- **Responsive Design**: CSS is a critical tool for creating **responsive web design**, ensuring that websites adapt and look appealing on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Media queries and flexible layouts are commonly used for this purpose.

- **CSS Preprocessors**: Many developers use **CSS preprocessors** like Sass and Less to streamline and enhance CSS code. These preprocessors offer features such as variables, nesting, and functions, which make styling more efficient and maintainable.
